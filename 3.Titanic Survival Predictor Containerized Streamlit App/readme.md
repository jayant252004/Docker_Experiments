# 🌊 **Titanic Survival Predictor:- Containerized Streamlit App**

## 📌 **Overview**
The **Titanic Survival Prediction Model** is a machine learning-based web application that determines the likelihood of a passenger surviving the Titanic disaster. It is developed using **Python**, with **scikit-learn**, **pandas**, and **Streamlit** powering the backend and frontend. The application is packaged with **Docker** to facilitate seamless deployment and execution across different environments.

## 📂 **Project Structure**

```bash
Titanic-Prediction-Model/
│── Dockerfile
│── requirements.txt
│── main.py
│── titanic_model.py
│── titanic_model.pkl
```

### **📜 File Descriptions:**
- **`main.py`** → The primary script for the Streamlit-based user interface.
- **`titanic_model.py`** → Contains the logic to train and save the Titanic survival prediction model.
- **`titanic_model.pkl`** → Pre-trained machine learning model stored for quick predictions.
- **`requirements.txt`** → Lists dependencies required for the application.
- **`Dockerfile`** → Defines the containerization instructions using Docker.

## 🤖 **Model Training (`titanic_model.py`)**
The model utilizes a **Random Forest Classifier** from `scikit-learn` to analyze Titanic dataset features. Once trained, the model is stored as **`titanic_model.pkl`** using `joblib` for efficient retrieval within the web application.

### **Key Steps in `titanic_model.py`**
1. **Load and preprocess the Titanic dataset**.
2. **Handle missing values and encode categorical features**.
3. **Train the Random Forest Classifier**.
4. **Save the trained model** in a serialized format.

## 🎨 **Streamlit Web Application (`main.py`)**
This interactive Streamlit-based web app provides an intuitive interface where users can enter passenger details and receive real-time predictions regarding survival chances.

### **✨ Features:**
✔️ **Simple, responsive, and easy-to-use interface**  
✔️ **Instant survival prediction based on user input**  
✔️ **Interactive sliders and dropdowns for seamless input selection**  

---

## 🐳 **Docker Integration**
The project is containerized using **Docker**, ensuring it runs consistently across different systems without dependency conflicts.

### **📄 `Dockerfile`**
```dockerfile
# Use Python 3.12 slim as base image
FROM python:3.12-slim

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app
