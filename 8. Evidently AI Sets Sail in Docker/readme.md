# 🚢 Evidently AI Sets Sail in Docker: A Voyage into Data Monitoring 🐳📊

## 📌 Overview

This guide explains how to set up an `Evidently AI` dashboard within a `Streamlit` application and run it inside a `Docker` container. With this setup, you can:

- Monitor machine learning models effectively.
- Interact with a dynamic dashboard powered by `Streamlit`.
- Manage reports and projects efficiently.
- Leverage `Docker` for seamless deployment and scalability.

## 📝 Application Core (`app.py` Overview)

The `app.py` script manages the following functionalities:

- Dynamically loads projects and available reports.
- Provides user-friendly project selection and period filtering.
- Integrates `Evidently AI` reports seamlessly within `Streamlit`.
- Implements error handling for missing reports or projects.
- Utilizes `src/ui.py` for UI rendering and `src/utils.py` for backend logic.

Key functions include:

- `display_sidebar_header()`: Creates a sidebar for navigation.
- `select_project()`: Allows users to choose a project.
- `select_period()`: Enables selection of reporting periods.
- `select_report()`: Retrieves and lists available reports.
- `display_report()`: Loads and displays selected reports interactively.

## 🐳 Docker Configuration (`Dockerfile`)

```dockerfile
# Use Python base image
FROM python:3.10

# Define working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy dependencies and install them
COPY requirements.txt /app/
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir --break-system-packages -r requirements.txt

# Copy the full project into the container
COPY . /app/

# Expose the Streamlit port
EXPOSE 8501

# Run the Streamlit app
CMD ["streamlit", "run", "app.py", "--server.port=8501", "--server.address=0.0.0.0"]
```
